# JustPureJS - pure JavaScript widgets for brutalist websites.

JurePureJS is here to help you build usable web apps.
It was inspired by Craigslist and brutalismwebsites.com.
It has some common widgets which even modest website will benefit from.
It just simple HTML, pure Javascript with no dependencies and a little bit
of CSS.
Nothing fancy.

## Widgets

Following are implemented:

- calendar
- tags
- list editing


# Contributing

I would like to grow JustPureJS, and thus contributions are welcome.
The idea was to make the code simple, easy and clean, so that extending and maintaining is easy.

If possible, stick to variable naming which already exists:

- `_cln`: class name
- `el`: DOM element object
- `elv`: DOM element value
