for wordmogul, in multiple places, I'll need dynamic lists.
Basically you press a + and you get a new element in the list,
ready for editing. will try to implement that now.

xx: it's good to have a naming scheme and stick to it. mine will be:
    whatever is _el, will be an element of the website (aka DOM structure).

@todo: crap, i'm on the flight and missing html spec. I think I need to figure out
       the <li> syntax

xx: another naming convention that when, if sticked to, helps a lot:
    if list is _list then the list item could be _list_item etc.

    when i see 'list' blah blah adding and then '.._list_item' it makes more sense


// i see some wiggling there. I think it's because the elements in there move
// when we add a border.

// I'm inspired by the "Remember The Milk" a little bit. When you hover there, it 
// surrounds the element with the border and then when you click, you can actually
// edit it. I want to have something similar. This is also a UI pattern in Jira.
// RTM i can show you.
// adding a pencil on the right will be another thing...
